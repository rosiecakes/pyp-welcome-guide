# Mentors Guide

* Answering questions and providing help

## Answering questions and providing help

Our work is to be online in the #mentors-help channel in Slack. Students will post messages asking for help. If we decide to help them, we'll just add a reaction to the studen'ts message:

What type of reaction? Your choice. Surprise us!

**Once a message has a reaction, that means a mentor has decided to take care of that issue**, the other mentors will just ignore that message.
